# ABAP Learning Repository
Welcome to my ABAP learning repository! Here, you'll find some exercises that I've made while learning ABAP.

## Introduction
The first set of activities in this repository focuses on introductory exercises aimed at understanding various aspects of ABAP. These exercises cover topics such as:
- Declaring different types of variables (structures, internal tables, dates, times, strings, etc.).
- Creating custom data types.
- Exploring fundamental concepts in ABAP development.

## Classes and Unit Tests
The second set of activities in this repository contains exercises related to classes and unit testing in ABAP. In this section, I learned about:
- Writing unit tests to ensure that the code is running as expected.
- Understanding object-oriented principles in the context of ABAP programming.
