# ABAP Learning Repository
Welcome to my ABAP learning repository! Here, you'll find some exercises that I've made while learning ABAP.

## Introduction
The first set of activities in this repository focuses on introductory exercises aimed at understanding various aspects of ABAP. These exercises cover topics such as:
- Declaring different types of variables (structures, internal tables, dates, times, strings, etc.).
- Creating custom data types.
- Exploring fundamental concepts in ABAP development.

## Classes and Unit Tests
The second set of activities in this repository contains exercises related to classes and unit testing in ABAP. In this section, I learned about:
- Writing unit tests to ensure that the code is running as expected.
- Understanding object-oriented principles in the context of ABAP programming.

## Dependencies and Database Access
This third set of exercises will focus on database table access through ABAP code and testing classes that have dependencies with other classes or database tables. Each exercise should be implemented using classes, following the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD). I learned about the following topics:
- Practice accessing database tables using ABAP code.
- Test classes with dependencies.
- Mock dependencies, such as database access or other classes, in unit tests.

## User Story - Contract Creation Simplified
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a basic model for contract creation, focusing on key fields and business rules.
- Practiced creating and accessing database tables using ABAP code.
- Structured data in header and item tables.
- Followed best practices in ABAP coding standards.
- Improved skills in debugging ABAP programs.
- Tested ABAP programs using SAP's built-in testing tools.
